## 1. Project Name and Description

**Project Name:** CampusConnect Mobile Application  

**Description:**  
The University currently relies on multiple legacy systems to deliver student services such as Grades, Campus News, Transportation, and Course Registration. Feedback from the Student Union indicates that 40% of students struggle to use these systems on mobile devices, resulting in missed deadlines and reduced engagement.

The CampusConnect project aims to consolidate these services into a single, unified mobile application for iOS and Android platforms, improving accessibility, usability, and overall student experience.

**Objectives:**  
- Improve accessibility and ease of use of university services for students.  
- Increase student engagement with digital services.  
- Reduce missed registration deadlines.  
- Deliver a secure, reliable, and high-performing mobile application within the approved budget and timeline.
