## 1. Executive Summary & Business Case
The University currently relies on four separate legacy systems to provide student services, including Grades, News, Campus Transportation, and Course Registration. Feedback collected by the Student Union indicates that approximately 40% of students find these systems difficult to navigate on mobile devices. This has resulted in missed course registration deadlines and reduced student engagement.

The CampusConnect project aims to consolidate these services into a single, unified mobile application available on both iOS and Android platforms. This initiative will improve accessibility, streamline service delivery, and significantly enhance the overall student experience.

## 2. Project Goal
To design, develop, and launch a fully functional mobile portal (CampusConnect) that enables students to access essential university services through a secure single sign-on (SSO) solution by the start of the Fall Semester.

---

## 3. Project Objectives (Success Criteria)
- **Adoption:** Achieve at least 1,500 unique student downloads within 30 days of launch.  
- **Performance:** Ensure application load times are under 3 seconds on 4G/5G networks.  
- **Reliability:** Maintain 99.9% system uptime during the course registration period.  
- **Budget:** Complete the project within the approved budget of $50,000 USD.

## 9. Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions
- Legacy system APIs will remain available and stable throughout the project lifecycle.  
- Required stakeholders and student participants will be available for reviews and User Acceptance Testing.  
- App Store review and approval timelines will follow standard processing durations.

### Constraints
- Fixed project budget of $50,000 USD.  
- Mandatory launch deadline prior to the start of the Fall Semester.  
- Compliance with university IT security standards and applicable data privacy regulations.

## 10. Key Risks
- **Technical Risk:** Legacy system API performance may be insufficient, requiring the implementation of caching or middleware solutions.  
- **Schedule Risk:** Delays in Apple App Store or Google Play Store approval processes may impact the planned launch date.  
- **Privacy & Compliance Risk:** The application will handle sensitive student data and must comply with FERPA and GDPR requirements.
